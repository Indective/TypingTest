future:
• Integrate with a lightweight database. Transition from file-based storage to a database like SQLite to improve scalability and enable features like advanced search, event categorization, and filtering.

• Implement event editing and deletion. Allow users to modify or remove events, not just schedule and view them. This will make your scheduler more user-friendly and practical.

• Add support for recurring events. Implement logic to schedule events on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, and manage recurrence rules so that an event automatically repeats on specified intervals.
